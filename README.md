# Multivariate_Leaf_Disease_Detection

This is an Image processing project done as part of undergraduate final year thesis.

Image processing is used to ->
* Detect whether a leaf is infected by some desease
* Determine the type of disease

In this project I have tried to present a model that ->
* Employs GCLM technique to extract features
* Multi-SVM classifier to identify Multiple Crop disease

So that Farmers can ->
* Detect leaf disease soon
* Minimize production and economic loses
* Ensure  quality and quantity of agricultural projects
* Minimize agrochemical use
